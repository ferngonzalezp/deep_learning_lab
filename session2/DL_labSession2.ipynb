        "Convolutional neural networks or more commonly called by their abreviation \"CNNs\", is one of the most used architecure types of Neural Networks. These networks were inspired by the field of image processing, they use as building block the convolution operation instead of simple matrix multiplications. The use of convolutions have some advantages, such as:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Reduced memory requirements: with convolutions the weights are filter or kernels that pass through the whole image, for example a 3x3 kernel has in total 9 weights and can be used in any image whose dimensions are equal or bigger than the ones from the kernel, if we used a linear layer the number of weights increase linearly with the number of pixels in the image.\n",

One of the most fundamental techniques used to better the convergence of SGD is momentum.  The most intuitive way to understand momentum is making an anlogy with the physical world, imagine we have a sphere that goes with a initial speed, if the sphere encounters an uphill it may get stucked because its momentum is not enough for conquering gravity. We can overcome this problem if we add a bigger slope before hill so we can reach our goal at the end.\n",
